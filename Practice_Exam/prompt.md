Create an HTML/PHP program that will allow the user to input a client’s :

first name, [firstName]
last name, [lastName]
contact phone number, [phoneNumber]
a room’s length, [roomLength]
and a room's width, [roomWidth]

allow them to choose :
ceramic tile, [ceramicFloor] = 5.27
carpet, [carpetFloor] = 9.90
wood plank [woodFloor] = 8.70
or linoleum floors. [LinoFloor] = 3.90

This page will **display all the user's input** as well as [write that data to a file].
A PHP program will then **calculate the square footage of the room** and **display the cost of the flooring**.
Your file should be written as **one record per line separated by colons** and **allow multiple orders written to the same file**.

You need to **calculate the square footage (rounded UP)** – room length \* room width. The cost of ceramic tile is $5.20 per square foot, carpet is $9.90 per square foot, wood plank is $8.70 per square foot and linoleum floors is $3.90 per square foot.

Additionally have a link to a report that will also show all the “estimates” in a table as well as how many jobs are ceramic tile, carpet, wood plank and linoleum. Be able to display the report and start over and give another estimate.
