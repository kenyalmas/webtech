paint-estimate.html algorithm:

    Prompt for length
    Get  length
    Prompt for width
    Get width
    Prompt for height
    Get height
    submit to paint-estimate.php

END



paint-estimate.php algorithm:

   Receive length, width, & height from paint-estimate.html
   longWalls = length * height
   wideWalls = width * height
   ceiling = length * width
   totalArea = (longWalls * 2) + (wideWalls * 2) + ceiling

   paintCost = 17
   paintCoverage = 400
   paintAmount = totalArea / paintCoverage
   costForPaint = paintAmount * paintCost

   coveragePerHour = 200
   painterHourly = 25.00
   timeToPaint = totalArea / coveragePerHour
   costToPaint = timeToPaint * painterHourly

   TotalCost = costToPaint + costForPaint

END
