	Purpose:Chapter 12 Exercise

	modify4.php uses a print statement to display some demographic information about France.
	Modify this application to use an associative array named $franceInfo to store the four values
	("65.8", "Paris", "French", and "franc"). Use meaningful names for the array keys.

	Now modify the print statement so that it uses the $franceInfo array to obtain the four values.
	You do not to change modify4.html which just runs the program.
